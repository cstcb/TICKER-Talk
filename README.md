   (a repository contain folders and files, images, videos, data sets, etc.)

1.1 Functionalities
- Free to download source codes, user account required for contributing contents
- User & Organizational Account 
	- Free to use public repository (viewable by anyone)
	- Paid (HK$7/month) to use public repository
	- Team (HK$9/month) A/C for user permission
	- Business (HK$21/month) for hosting & other support

1.2 Popularity
- Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter also have their own Github pag

2. Demos

2.1  Creating a Repository
  - Start a repository
  - Update the readme file
  - Create a branch (version control)
  - Create a page https://sslau852.github.io/TICKER-Talk/
    - (reference at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
  - GitHub Desktop – an alternative for programming

2.2. Looking for resources
  - Search “penetration testing”
  - Found source codes for lots of penetration testing tools 
  - Find “SECFORCE/Sparta” 
  - Even cheat sheets!

3. Practical Exercise 

3.1 CloudFail
    - Introduction of CloudFail
    - Installation of CouldFail
    -  Deployment of CloudFail
    - Verification of result

3.2 RouterSploit
    - Introduction of RouterSploit
    - Installation of RouterSploit
    - Deployment of RouterSploit

4. Practical Use

4.1 Misuse in hosting – 查詢警員資料
      - (Source: http://police-github.github.io)
   - Background – violation of PDPO
   - Looking into html & JSON source codes
   - Malware sample – theZoo
     (Source: https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/issues)
     
4.2 Investigation
   - Subpoena required!
   - Knowledge in programming (+ possibly Linux) required

5. Food for Thought
   - Too little time, too many resources
   - How to keep passionate on developing research capability?
   - CS / TC -> need time + room for internalization
   -Training is important, self-learning is crucial!
