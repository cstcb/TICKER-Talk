-2.1  Creating a Repository
	- Start a repository
	- Update the readme file
	- Create a branch (version control)
	- Create a page https://sslau852.github.io/TICKER-Talk/
         (reference at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
        - GitHub Desktop – an alternative for programming

2.2. Looking for resources
2.2.1 Search “penetration testing”
     - Found source codes for lots of penetration testing tools 
     - Find “SECFORCE/Sparta” 
     - Even cheat sheets!
